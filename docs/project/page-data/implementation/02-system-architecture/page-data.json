They can be directly integrated in other software products to benefit developers. </p>\n<h1>The Unified Bot Format</h1>\n<p>During our previous proof of concepts <a href=\"../00-prototype-roadmap\">HERE</a>, we decided to convert VoiceFlow design data into a more convenient format we could work with. Since we were already doing format conversion we started thinking: what if we define a generalised bot design format instead? This brings the major benefit that we become way less reliant on VoiceFlow and their format, as well as opening the door to interfacing with other design environments. For example, Microsoft’s Bot Composer Framework could be an interesting expansion <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/install-composer\">LINK</a>. </p>\n<p>From our research with other design platforms <a href=\"../../research/2-voiceflow-alternatives\">LINK</a>, we had some experience with the capabilities and requirements of alternative platforms. So we came up with the design of the Unified Bot Format. It is a JSON format representing a graph of a conversation flow between multiple choice questions. It is explained further <a href=\"../03-unified-bot-format\">HERE</a>. </p>\n<h1>UBF SMS Interface</h1>\n<p>While working on the UI we decided to define an abstracting functional interface. This would hide the complexity of the business logic as it is not within the responsibility of the UI to be aware of that. In addition, we were also aware that if the NHS were to deploy our system nation-wide, we would have to use a different SMS service to Twilio. </p>\n<p>These factors led to the decision to create a common functional interface for an SMS backend. That interface would support creating SMS bots in Unified Bot Format, as well as managing the created bot instances and assigning phone numbers to them. We used our experience with alternative SMS platforms <a href=\"../../research/6-twilio-alternatives\">HERE</a> to ensure that the interface generalises well. It is documented further <a href=\"../04-ubf-sms-interface\">HERE</a>. </p>\n<h1>Why a Standalone Frontend?</h1>\n<p>Because we placed big emphasis in our research on reusing as much technology as possible, the pros and cons of which are elaborated <a href=\"../../research/5-the-sms-dilemma\">HERE</a>, we do not have a backend. Our implementation of the UBF SMS Interface runs entirely in the frontend and stores all relevant data in Twilio servers. The application is standalone and does not store any local state. Anyone with access to a Twilio account can use our app to manage all bots uploaded on that account. </p>\n<p>In short this allows us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce the complexity enormously. </li>\n<li>No risk of losing data locally. </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What About The Business Logic?</h1>\n<p>The module <code class=\"language-text\">vf-to-ubf</code> implements the <code class=\"language-text\">Unified Bot Format</code> by converting VoiceFlow designs to it.
